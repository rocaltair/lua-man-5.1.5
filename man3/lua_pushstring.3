lua_pushstring - liblua API documentation

.SH PROPERTIES
[-0, +1, \fBm\fP]
.SH SYNOPSIS
void lua_pushstring (lua_State *L, const char *s);

.SH DESCRIPTION

.sp
Pushes the zero-terminated string pointed to by \fBs\fP
onto the stack.
Lua makes (or reuses) an internal copy of the given string,
so the memory at \fBs\fP can be freed or reused immediately after
the function returns.
The string cannot contain embedded zeros;
it is assumed to end at the first zero.
