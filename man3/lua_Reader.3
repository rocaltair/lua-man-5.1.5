lua_Reader - liblua API documentation

.SH SYNOPSIS
typedef const char * (*lua_Reader) (lua_State *L, void *data, size_t *size);

.SH DESCRIPTION

.sp
The reader function used by \fBlua_load\fP.
Every time it needs another piece of the chunk,
\fBlua_load\fP calls the reader,
passing along its \fBdata\fP parameter.
The reader must return a pointer to a block of memory
with a new piece of the chunk
and set \fBsize\fP to the block size.
The block must exist until the reader function is called again.
To signal the end of the chunk,
the reader must return \fBNULL\fP or set \fBsize\fP to zero.
The reader function may return pieces of any size greater than zero.
